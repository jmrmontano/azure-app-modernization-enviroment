## Overview

The App Modernization hands-on lab is an exercise that will challenge you to implement an end-to-end migration and modernization scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Microsoft Azure App Services and related services. The scenario will include implementing compute, storage, security, and search, using various components of Microsoft Azure. The hands-on lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members at the lab to model a real-world experience and to allow each member to  share their expertise for the overall solution.

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription (non-Microsoft subscription)
2. **Global Administrator role** for Azure AD within your subscription
3. Local machine with Remote Desktop installed

## Before the hands-on lab

**Duration**: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will set up your environment for use for the rest of the exercises. This will involve downloading the assets from the repository and deploying them to Azure. We will use your workstation to set up the environment and connect to Virtual Machines via Remote Desktop.

### Task 1: Set up the environment

1.  Open your browser to https://aka.ms/appmodernization
2.  Click on the **Deploy to Azure** button

    ![App Migration & Modernization Workshop GitHub Repository](images/media/image2-github-deploy-to-azure.jpeg)

3.  Select an **Azure Subscription**
4.  Create a new **Resource Group**
5.  Chose the **East US** location

    ![ARM Template Parameters](images/media/image3-arm-template-deployment.jpeg)

6.  Accept the terms and conditions
7.  Click on the **Purchase** button

    ![ARM Template Deployment](images/media/image4-accept-terms-and-conditions.jpeg)

**Exit criteria**

- Initiate the environment deploy from the repository
- Verify the website runs in Azure (IaaS)
- Note the URLs of the provisioned web for future reference
- Save the database connection string for later

**Default Settings**

- VM Admin User Name: sysadmin  
- VM Admin User Password: Password$123
- Database Login Name: workshopServiceAcc  
- Database User Name: workshopServiceAcc  
- Database User Password: P2ssw0rd
- Database Name: partsUnlimitedDB

**Note**: if you don't have a Visual Studio Enterprise License, please select the community edition for the Dev Workstation OS Version.

**Note:** Do not modify the values for **\_artifacts Location** or **\_artifacts Location SAS Token**.

  ![ARM Template Deploying](images/media/image5-deployment-tile.jpeg)

Clicking on the tile will show you deployment information and status.Â This shows all the parameters that were used as part of your deployment, and at the bottom of the blade, will show you the deployment status:

  ![ARM Template Operation Details](images/media/image6-arm-deployment-status.jpeg)

Refreshing the blade will update the deployment status.Â  The deployment will first create the vNet, then the web and SQL servers in parallel, and finally create the developer workstation and deploy the app.Â The entire process should take between 18 and 25 minutes.

You can navigate away from this page and review the resource group.Â In the top right of the resource group, you will also see deployment information.

  ![ARM Template Deployment Status](images/media/image7-resource-group-deployments.jpeg)

Clicking this link will take you to the list of completed and active deployments

  ![ARM Template Deployment Status](images/media/image8-resource-group-deployments-details.jpeg)

Once the deployment is complete, review the vmweb01 configuration to find the public URL.Â  Copy the URL, open a browser, and paste and go to verify that everything worked correctly.

  ![VM Web 01 URL](images/media/image9-vm-dns-name.jpeg)

You should see the Parts Unlimited web site launch like below.

  ![Parts Unlimited Web App](images/media/image10-vm-web-app-running.jpeg)

### Task 2: Validate you can connect to the Development Environment

Now that the environment is set up, we need to make sure we can connect to the development environment where we will be doing the exercises for this workshop.

1. Verify connectivity to the development virtual machine
2. Sign in to Visual Studio
3. Remote into the vmdev01 using the User Name and Password used when creating the environment.

    ![VM Sign In](images/media/image11-vm-credentials.png)

4. Click **âSign Inâ**. Type your Microsoft Account or Corporate Account, whichever account name you use for your Visual Studio Subscription (MSDN).

    ![Visual Studio Sing In](images/media/image12-vs-sign-in.png)

5. Open the Solution which is located at **C:\\Source\\AppWorkshop\\IaaS2PaaSWeb\\IaaS2PaaSWeb.sln**

Write the values defined during the setup:

Web Site URL: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

VM User Name: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

VM User Name Password: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

While this is just the initial setup process, note that everything has been automated using a combination of Azure Resource Management Templates, PowerShell, and PowerShell DSC. This technique can be used to support a DevOps process even if you are deploying to IaaS based environments.

## Exercise 1: Migration to Azure PaaS

**Duration**: 30 minutes

Parts Unlimited is in the auto part business. They typically sell via a brick and mortar store but have invested in a small e-commerce presence to augment those stores. They have seen an uptick in use from customers and have been getting some complaints about the speed of the site and requests for additional features and functionality.

Parts Unlimited would like to expand and improve their ecommerce presence, experiment with new features and business strategies to help grow the business. However, they are not interested in sinking large sums of money into hardware and the management of that hardware. They want to quickly spin something up to see how it works, scale it if it
does, and deprovision it if it doesnât. They also want more flexibility in how they scale their solutions given the seasonal nature of what they do.

Currently, Parts Unlimited consists of an ASP.NET 4.5.1 website running on Microsoft Windows 2016 and SQL database running on Microsoft SQL 2016. You need to migrate that application to a Microsoft Azure App Service Web Site and a Microsoft SQL Azure Database.

With the website migrated, you immediately gain new capabilities that you can use to improve your site and accelerate business value:

- Deployment Slots
- Testing in Production
- Scale up / Scale out
- Authentication Support for Azure AD, Facebook, twitter, etc.
- Diagnostic Tools
- Security Center
- No OS to manage or patch

These features setup Parts Unlimited for future enhancement and scale without having to plan for and manage infrastructure.

**Exit criteria**

- Azure App Service instances should be created with the application
- Note the URLs of the provisioned web for future reference
- Save the new database connection string for later

### Task 2: Validate Application Migration

After a few minutes, your site and content will be ready to go.Â  Click the link to view your site.

Ask yourself: How did the web site connect to the database? Did the migration tool modify the Web.Config file with the new database? Weâll answer that below.

Go back to the Azure portal and look at the Resource Groups.Â  You will see a new Resource Group called "Server-Migration-\<location\>." or the name you entered in the migration tool.

![Server Migration Resource Group](images/media/image42.jpeg)

Navigate into the resource group to inspect the services that were created.

![Server Migration Resource Group Resources](images/media/image43.jpeg)

You should have 4 items:

- SQL Server
- SQL Database
- App Service Plan
- App Service

Click the web app and then click app settings so we can have a look at what was created.

![Web App - Application Settings](images/media/image44.jpeg)

Notice there are lots of options, we will be discussing them throughout this workshop.Â  However, note the connection string.Â  The App Service will override application settings defined in your Web.Config, making it easy to manage and secure.

Go back to the resource group and click on the App Service Plan.Â  The app service plan defines the infrastructure your app is hosted on.Â Scale Up defines the instance size you are running on and scale out defines the number of instances.

## Exercise 2: Implementing DevOps Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

**Duration**: 45 minutes

Parts Unlimited wants to improve their deployment process to enable more agility. Currently, Parts Unlimited has a very manual deployment process. Developers document the install steps and operations performs the deployment. This process worked when they pushed code only a few times a year. However, the goal is to rapidly deliver value in days as opposed to months.

Currently, there is no automated deployment process.  has been chosen as the ALM/DevOps platform moving forward. You will implement a CI/CD process from Team Services to Azure. Once the CI/CD process is in place you can quickly deploy changes to production with full traceability. The automation not only shortens your delivery time, it also dramatically improves the repeatability. Additionally, you can add unit testing, automated UI testing, Load Testing, Manual Testing, approval processes, etc. to ensure you do not sacrifice quality for speed.

Next, we are going to change the origin of our Git repo and push an it to Azure DevOps.Â  If not already visible, you can navigate to the **Repos \> Files** of Azure DevOps where you will be presented with the commands (with some small changes) to push the code to the repo.Â  This will be specific to your Azure DevOps subscription and your project name so type in what Azure DevOps shows you.

    ![Azure DevOps - Repository](images/media/image51.jpeg)

### Task 2: Upload Code to Git Repository in Azure DevOps

1. Connect via Remote Desktop to the **vmdev01** virtual machine using the User Name and Password provided when creating the environment.

    ![Remote Desktop Connection](images/media/image52.png)

    > **Reminder**:
    >
    > Default Admin: sysadmin
    >
    > Default Password: Password$123

2. Open a command prompt and execute the following commands:

    ```Bash
    C:\windows\system32> cd C:\Source\AppWorkshop
    C:\Source\AppWorkshop> git remote set-url origin <REPO URL>
    C:\Source\AppWorkshop> git push -u origin --all
    ```

    **Note**: 

    > ![Azure Repos](images/media/image54.png)

The command will look like git remote set-url origin
**https://risslandâ¦â¦**..

Type in the command and hit enter to change the origin from GitHub to
Azure DevOps

Next, execute **git push -u origin --all**

Youâll be prompted for your credentials.

> ![](images/media/image55.png)

After you have entered your credentials, your commit will be pushed to
Azure DevOps

> ![](images/media/image56.png)

Once you entered the commands, refresh the browser. Â You should now see
the workshop code in your Azure DevOps repository.

> Â 
> 
> ![](images/media/image57.png)

### Task 3: Use Deployment Center to create CI/CD

Go back to the Azure portal and open the Azure App Service Web Site you
created when you used the Migration Tool. It will be in the
Server-Migration-XXXX Resource Group.

You will want to pick the "Deployment Center (Preview)â

> ![](images/media/image58.png)

Next, you will see an overview page, click Azure DevOps

> ![](images/media/image59.png)

Next, youâll have a choice of Build Providers, App Service Kudu build
server or Azure DevOps Continuous Delivery.

> ![](images/media/image60.png)

Â Click on **Azure DevOps Continuous Delivery**

Configure where the source code is located and which Web Application
Framework to use for your Build

> ![](images/media/image61.png)

**Note**:

If you don't click on each dropdown, the OK button won't enable.

> ![](images/media/image62.png)

While you can setup Load Testing here, we are going to leave this option
set to On change leave the default values.

Web apps have a feature called deployment slots.Â  This helps you deploy
to a test environment prior to going to production.Â  We are going to
click Yes and let the wizard set this up for us.

> ![](images/media/image63.png)

Click yes, choose to create a **New** Deployment Slot, and name the slot
'Staging'

> Â 
> 
> ![](images/media/image64.png)

Â 

Click Continue

You should see a summary like the following:

> ![](images/media/image65.png)
> 
> Â 

Verify the configuration and then click **Finish**.

The service will trigger a Build in Azure DevOps, create a new Web Application
for Test environment and create a new staging Slot.

This process may take a few minutes. When its complete, youâll see a
summary screen like the following:

> ![](images/media/image66.png)

Going back to Azure DevOps, click on Build and Release, then click on Builds.Â 
You should see the build definition that was generated for you.

**Note**:

Looks like there is a bug in the migration tool.Â  It doesn't property
put the connection string in the app settings correctly. Remember how we
fixed this before?

**Note**: This is an opportunity to see how you can troubleshoot the
environment using Kudu, diagnostics, deployment slots, etc. Navigation
with your web browser to https://\[webname\].scm.azurewebsites.net.

To AvoidÂ the errorâ¦â¦â¦.

Note that the name of the connection string is
"DefaultConnectionString", which we captured before starting the CI/CD
pipeline creation.

> ![(add (connectionstrings\> -\<add (add (system. web\> \<customErrors
> mode= \<compilation debug-"true](images/media/image71.jpeg)
> 
> Â 

When the migration tools moved the application, it doesn't correctly add
the connection string name.Â  Note that the connection string is simply
"DefaultConnection"

> ![DEPLOYMENT Application settings Quickstart WEBSITE NODE DEFAULT

> 
> Â 

To avoid an error, simply edit the connection string name in both the
production website and the staging slot to read
"DefaultConnectionString" and save your settings. For the Database, use
**SQLAzure**.

**Note**:

If youâre using Azure DevOps, consider managing ConnectionString values in
Release using the appropriate task.

### Task 3 (Alternative): Use Azure DevOps to create CI/CD 

Go back to the Azure portal and open the Azure App Service Web Site you
created when you used the Migration Tool. It will be in the
Server-Migration-XXXX Resource Group.

**Part A - Setup A Deployment Slot**

Open the Server-Migration-\*\*\*\* resource group and click on the web
application

Â

Â 

Â 

At this time, there are no deployment slots configured for your
website.Â  A deployment slot is used to setup a staging environment for
your application, so you can test new changes easily prior to rolling
them to production.

Click the Add Slot option to add a new deployment slot.

Â 

**Part B - Setup CI/CD**

Open your new Team Services Account \*\*\*\*.VisualStudio.Com and view
the "Overview".Â  You should be presented with summary information about
your project with a very prominent "Set up Build" Buttonâ¦.. Click it.

Â 

Â 

Next, you will be shown the build process with some options that need to
be configured.Â  First, in the "Azure Subscription" drop down, pick the
Azure subscription which is hosting your migrated web application and
then click the "Authorize" button.

Â 

Â 

**Note:** It is assumed that you are using the same login for your Azure DevOps
account and your azure subscription.Â  If this is not the case, the Azure
subscription may not be shown in the drop down and you will need to
manually add it to Azure DevOps.Â  If this is the case, simply ask your
instructor or proctor to assist you.Â  Should take no more than a few
minutes to setup.

Â 

Once the subscription has been Authorized, Azure DevOps is able to enumerate the
App Services in your subscription and populate the drop down.Â  Simply
pick the App Service you wish to deploy to.

**Part C - Leverage the Deployment Slot and implementing a Release**

While we are deploying our application as part of a build, it may be a
better option to leave the creation of artifacts to the build and move
deployment of said artifacts to a release.Â  To quickly create a new
release, click the "Create Release" option.

Â

Â 

Just like when creating a new build, you are presented with a selection
of templates to use as your starting point.Â  Select the "Azure App

Almost done, we just want to make a couple of additional modifications
to take advantage of the deployment slot we configured earlier.

Click the "Deploy Azure App Service" task so we get access to all the
configuration options.Â  We will want to check the "Deploy to Slot" check
box, pick the resource group, then select the "staging" slot that we
configured earlier.

Â 

At this point, the release will simply deploy to our staging slot and
nothing will be changed in production until we swap production with
staging.Â  We can do this as part of our release by adding another task.

Click on the "+" to add a new task.Â  Search for "Swap" and add the
"Azure App Service Manage" task to your release process.

Â 

The CI/CD pipeline is complete.Â  Queue a new build and follow the
build/release to verify it works correctly.Â  Follow the build process
and then follow the release process.

Â 

Note: While we are moving the deployment capabilities to the release and
using deployment slots, we did not create multiple environments to save
time.Â  If you like, you could create a new environment in the release
and move the "Swap Slots" task to the second environment and add
approval
processes.

## Exercise 3: Detect, Diagnose, Monitor Application Performance with Application Insights

Duration: 45 minutes

Parts Unlimited understands that bad experiences online will quickly
drive a customer to your competitor. With that in mind, they want to
gain better visibility into issues customers are experiencing while
using their site.

In addition to gaining better insights into the sites health, they are
also interested in better understanding how customers are using the site
and the sites effectiveness.

As there is no instrumentation on the site today, they have decided to
add Application Insights telemetry.

Timely actionable telemetry is an important aspect of any modern
application. Actionable information is a vital component of any DevOps
practice.

  - Add Application Insights to the web app

  - Modify the code to instrument the app

  - Test locally to verify the app works

  - Push the changes to kick off a release

  - Test that the production application works

  - Review App Insights
Data

There are a lot of packages that need to be updated, but we are only
going to update one package.

We are looking for System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource.Â  Select that
package and click the update button.

Before checking in our code, we are going to want to test the
application locally.Â  To do this, verify that your connection string is
pointed to localDB.Â 

\<add name="DefaultConnectionString"
connectionString="Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=PartsUnlimitedWebsite;Integrated
Security=True;" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" /\>

Open the **WebConfig** file, uncomment the localDB connection string and
comment out the connection string pointing to a server and then save the
file.

> Â

Run your web application and verify everything runs correctly.Â 

**Note:** You want to move the instrumentation key to the Web.Config.Â 
This lets you override the key in production and easily use multiple
keys.Â  This blog has a nice post on how to do that;
[https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2015/01/07/application-insights-support-for-multiple-environments-stamps-and-app-versions/](mhtml:file://C:\\Users\\danshue\\Desktop\\Workshop\\AppMigrationAndModernizationWorkshopPresenter.mht!https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2015/01/07/application-insights-support-for-multiple-environments-stamps-and-app-versions/)
Â Â 

#### Task 3: Update your application to provide more telemetry

Azure Application Insights gives you a lot of information without doing
anything else.Â  However, we want a little more, so we are going to make
some changes.Â 

Open the \_Layout.cshtml file located in the views\\shared folder.

> ![Utils View Models Views Account Checkout Home Manage Orders Search
> Shared AdminMenu.cshtmI Announcement.cshtml CartSummary.cshtmI
> CategoryMenu.cshtmI \_ CommunityList.cshtmI \_Layout.cshtmI
> Login.cshtml Order.cshtml \_OrderCostSummary.cshtmI
> OrdersSearch.cshtmI
> ProductList.cshtmI](images/media/image114.jpeg)**Â **

There is a section commented out that will send telemetry from the web
page.Â  We are going to replace this code with code we get from the app
insights portal.

Next, go to Azure, open your resource group, then open Application
Insights.

Go back to Visual Studio and replace the commented Application Insights
script with the script from the portal.Â  When done, you code should look
like the following

> Â 
> 
> ![crlpts. Render( w/ bund Les/modernlzr (Scripts. Render ( "m/

> c.queue.p](images/media/image119.jpeg)
> 
> Â Â 

If you want, you can rerun the application to ensure it works correctly.

**Note**: There are other areas where you can add telemetry.Â  Some of
this code has been commented out if you want to add it.

**Note:** This project is .NET Framework 4.5.1.Â  More capabilities light
up if you change the target framework to at least .NET Framework 4.6.Â 

#### Task 4: Implement the Custom Event Telemetry Provider

A custom Event Telemetry Provider has been written, but the
implementation needs to be uncommented before it can be used. Navigate
to the **Utils** folder and edit the **TelemetryProvider.cs** file by
uncommenting the code and add to the top of the class â**using
Microsoft.ApplicationInsights;**â. This provider wraps the Azure
Application Insights SDK TelemetryClient and is used to record custom
events such as messages, traces, and exceptions. Its use can be found in
the **OrdersController.cs** or **ShoppingCartController.cs** classes.

![](images/media/image120.png)

#### Task 5: Push your code to production

With everything running locally, time to push our changes to production.

In Visual Studio, go to the team explorer, then go to changes.

Before moving to the next step, open a browser and navigate to the site.
Verify that your release was successful by viewing the source code in
the browser to ensure the Application Insights key was deployed to the
Web Application in Azure. You can do this by viewing the HTML source
code and look for Application Insights instrumentation key in the \<head
/\> block. Move around the site to generate data that will be used in
the next activity.

#### Task 5: Review the data

Go back to your resource group and open Application Insights.

#### Â Task 6: Web Test

Now we want to monitor the web application from different locations and
get a better understanding of what other users in different regions are
experiencing. Under the Investigate pane, click on **Availability**.
This will bring up a new blade that will allow you to add the new test.
Click on **Add Test**.

> ![](images/media/image131.png)

Type âMonitor Applicationâ for the âTest Nameâ and click on the **Test
Locations** and choose where you would like the application to be
monitored.

> ![](images/media/image132.png)

At this point, weâre only going to do a simple **URL ping test** to
verify that weâre getting a HTTP 200 returned from the application.

![](images/media/image133.png)

Last, before we create this new test, we want to set how we will be
alerting if we do get something other than a HTTP 200 response. In the
âsend alerts emails to these email addressâ textbox, type in your
email address. At this time, no Webhook will be called and this can be
left blank. We done, click OK to continue.

**Note**: There are many alerts possible and Azure Application Insights
is integrated with Azure Monitor.

Click **Create** to create the test.

In a few minutes, the Availability Test Summary will be updated, and you
will see test results from the of the locations youâve chosen.

## Exercise 4: Optimize and Protect Azure Web Application

Duration: 45 minutes

While the default settings for deploying web application may work in
many situations, we want to examine our Azure App Service Web
Application and ensure its secure, optimized, and able to meet the
demands of our customers. We will use the Azure portal to configure the
ensure backups, logging is enabled, and the application is sized and can
scale as need.

This lab will demonstrate how to safe guard and protect your application
and make it available by:

  - Resource Group cannot be deleted by creating a lock

  - Configure backups are setup with 120-day retention

  - Ensure the average response time is \< 2 seconds

  - Configure alerts exist for CPU \< 90 secs

  - Configure diagnostics and exception logging is configured

  - Ensure the average CPU \< 20%

  - Verify that thereâs 35 GB free space available

  - Scale up to a premium hosting model with \> 3GB RAM available

Azure App Service services keeps you informed about the state of your
application. It provides the ability to safe guard the application by
performing automatic backups, provides a consolidate method for
collection information about your application, has the ability of
scaling up/down and notifying you when it
does.

| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Auto Scaling    | <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/auto-scaling> |

#### Prerequisites

To complete this task, you should have provisioned the Parts Unlimited
IaaS and PaaS environments and have a working CI/CD process and have
installed & configure Azure Application Insights. You have logged in and
have configured Visual Studio and able to modify code.

#### Task 1: Configure Backups

We need to âstart rightâ by getting the backups going before we move
forward with too much code changes. Backups will be stored in defined
Azure storage account as ZIP files and contain an XML manifest of the
ZIP contents. SQL databases will be stored in a BACPAC file that can be
imported.

**Note**: Although the ZIP file and BACPAC file can be accessed,
altering any of the files will invalided the backup.

Navigation to the web application in the Azure Portal. Navigate to the
â**Backups**â under the settings section. Click the **Configure**
link.

![](images/media/image135.png)

If we had a Premium App Service Plan, we would be able to run Snapshots.
Since weâre running a Standard account, weâll configure our back up to
be performed when the traffic and volume is the lowest.

#### Task 2: Configure Storage Account for Backups

We need to define which Azure BLOB storage account to be used for
backups. Since we donât have an account, weâll create one. Click
âStorage not configuredâ and then on the Storage accounts pane, click
the **+Storage Account** to create a new storage account.

For ease of use, type of same name you use for the application as the
name of the storage account. Since this is just a backup account, keep
the default **Standard** for Performance and select the same âLocationâ
for the region where the application is being hosted. For Replication,
change the setting over to âGeo-redundant storage (GRS)â. Click **OK**
and it will take a few moments to provision the new storage account.

![](images/media/image136.png)

Once provisioned, select the new storage account from the list. Next, we
need to define where the backup will be written. Click **+Container**
and type in the name of the container, such as âbackupâ. The name must
be lowercase, at least 3 characters long and no more than 63 in length.
Each hypen must be followed by a non-hypen character. We donât want the
container/backups accessible externally, so make sure Public Access
level is set to Private, No anonymouse access.

![](images/media/image137.png)

Click **OK** and the in the Containers list, click on the container to
use and click **Select** to pick the container that will be used for the
backups.

![](images/media/image138.png)

Now that our Storage Account and Container has been selected, validate
you have the right setting on the Backup Configuration pane.

![](images/media/image139.png)

#### Task 3: Schedule Backup

Next, since we want the backup to be performed nightly, we need to turn
on the scheduled backups by clicking âScheduled backupâ to âOnâ.

![](images/media/image140.png)

The next steps are to define how often we want to perform the back up
and how many days we want to retain the backups. We only need to back up
daily, so select â1â for Days. We want our backup to kick off at 3:00
AM, type in 3:00 AM. We backups from the last 120 days, type that in the
Retention area.

![](images/media/image141.png)

#### Task 4: Backup Database

Azure App Service has detected a database in use, so weâll want to
include that in the back up as well. Click the **Include** checkmark to
also have it backed it. Database backups are available for SQL Database,
Azure Database for MySQL (Preview), Azure Database for PostgreSQL
(Preview), and MySQL in-app.

![](images/media/image142.png)

Validate the backup settings on more time and when youâve confirmed
everything meets your organizations policies, click **Save**.

![](images/media/image143.png)

Once the backup is defined, Azure will automatically preform its first
backup. It may take some time for the backup to appear, it depends on
the size of the application and database. For our application, this
should take only a few minutes to appear.

![](images/media/image144.png)

Once a backup has completed, we can use the Azure Portal to navigate to
the Container in the Storage Account and see the LOG, XML manifest, and
ZIP file containing the files.

![](images/media/image145.png)

###### Partial Backups

You can also configure Partial backups if you would like to exclude data
to limit how much youâre backing up such as logs and image files. 10 GB
is the max size available for backups currently.

###### Restore Backup

This is the same page youâll come to Restore a previous backup.

###### Automate Backup

Like many services in Azure, Application Service backups can also be
automated with scripts using either the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell.

#### Task 5: Viewing Health by Reviewing the Response Time and Errors

Navigate to the Application in the Azure Portal. The Overview section
gives you essential information about how your application is performing
such the Average Response Time, number of Requests, Data In/Out, and
Http 5xx. What is the average Response Time for the application?

![](images/media/image146.png)

#### Task 6: Setting Alerts

Now youâve seen basic performance information, letâs setup an early
warning system. Under the **Monitoring** section for the Web App, click
**Alerts (Classic).** This allows Azure to notify you when certain
conditions are of your resources are reached.

We want to create an alert when the CPU raises beyond 70% for a period
and be notified. Click **+Add alert metric (classic).** This as a new
rule that will be trigged when the condition is reached. Type the name
of the rule such as **High Average CPU**, next set the metric to CPU
Time, set the threshold to 70, check the email owners, and type in your
email address.

![](images/media/image147.png)

#### Task 7: Configuration App Diagnostics

Once we have the alerting and monitoring in place, we want to be able to
record issues as the arise. To enable diagnostics, under the Monitoring
section, click on **Diagnostics Logs**. Turn on Application Logging
(Filesystem) and Application Logging (Blob), select the level of logging
to **Error** for both**. **

**Note**: To view the Stream Log, logs must be written to local storage.

Next, we select the Storage Account you previously created for backups,
create a new container called **app-logs** and select it.

![](images/media/image148.png)

Create another new container called **web-server-logs** and turn on
**storage** for the Web server logging.

**Note**: Make sure each container has its access set to private (no
anonymous access).

For each log setting, set the retention period (days) to 120.

![](images/media/image149.png)

When everything is all set, click **Save**.

#### Task 8: Viewing Application CPU/Memory

We need to ensure that weâre âokâ right now. From a CPU/Mem standpoint.

![](images/media/image150.png)

#### Task 9: Viewing Disk space

Itâs important that we have room to grow. On the navigation, under the
App Service Plan, click on Quotas.

![](images/media/image151.png)

#### Task 10: Configuring Auto Scale Up

We know that the site runs poorly on a single CPU box. Letâs fix that
first. Navigate to the App Service Plan and **Scale Up** the application
to at least to a P2 instance.

![](images/media/image152.png)

#### Task 11: Creating an Auto Scaling Out

An advantage to running in Azure is auto-scaling the application up and
down based off the demand. In this lab, weâre going to create an auto
scale rule to handle peak loads.

In the search dialog in the Azure Portal, type âMonitorâ to navigate to
the Azure Monitor Service.

![](images/media/image153.png)

Under the Settings section, click on **AutoScale**. From the list of
services, select the App Plan to enable.

![](images/media/image154.png)

Verify you have the correct **App Plan** and click **Enable** auto
scale.

![](images/media/image155.png)

Next, set the rules for which the application will scale out and scale
back in.

![](images/media/image156.png)

Save the changes

#### Task 12: Prepare for scaling in another region 

Are you getting heavy traffic from another region or want to improve the
high available of your application? Now that we have a Premium App Plan,
we can clone the application and all its settings into a new App Service
Plan. That plan can be in the same Resource Group or a new Resource
Group.

![](images/media/image157.png)

Once youâve set up a new App Service Plan and Resource Group, now itâs
time to set the Clone Settings.

> ![](images/media/image158.png)

#### Task 13: Viewing Resource Health and History

Now we want to see the overall health history of our resource. Perhaps
there was an event that happen that made the application slow to respond
or simply want to make sure everything is going already. Navigate to
**Resource Health** under the Support + Troubleshooting section. Here
you can the current available and the last health events over the last
two weeks for the application.

![](images/media/image159.png)

#### Task 14: View Auto Scale Run History

To view the history on how often the web application is scaling up /
down, click on the **Run History** link.

![](images/media/image160.png)

#### Task 15: Setting up auto scaling notifications

If you want to be notified how when the application is scaled up / down,
Navigate to Notify.

![](images/media/image161.png)

## Exercise 5: Optimize and Secure Azure SQL Database

Duration: 45 minutes

While the default settings for deploying SQL database may work in many
situations, we want to examine the database and ensure its secure,
optimized, and able to meet the demands of our customers. We will use
the Azure portal to configure the ensure tuned, diagnostics is enabled,
and the database is sized and can scale as need.

This exercise will demonstrate how to safe guard and protect your
database and make it available by:

  - Database DTU utilization is \< 20%

  - \>= 3000 DTUs are available for the database

  - Database is accessible only from Azure (not externally)

  - Database is failover-ready to another region (without app code
    change)

  - Threat Detection is enabled

  - Automatic Tuning is enabled

  - Diagnostics are enabled

  - Alerts anytime DTU usage is \> 60%

  - Database vulnerabilities are automatically
discovered

#### Prerequisites

To complete this task, you should have provisioned the Parts Unlimited
IaaS and PaaS environments and have a working CI/CD process. You will
use the Developer Workstation deployed as part of the IaaS environment
for your development work.

#### Task 1: Resource Locking

We want to make sure than nobody accidentally deletes this footprint.
Unlike role-based access control, you use management locks to apply a
restriction across all users and roles. There are two settings:
**CanNotDelete** and **ReadOnly**. Locks are only limited to the
management of the resource itself, not the function of the resource. For
example, a ReadOnly lock on a SQL Database prevents you from deleting or
modifying the database, but does not prevent you from creating,
updating, or deleting data in the database. Only **Owner** and **User
Access Administrator** can create or delete management locks.

Navigate to the SQL Server database in the Azure Portal. In the Settings
blade for the SQL server database, select **Locks**.

**Note**: Locks can be applied at a resource, resource group, or
subscription that you wish to lock.

![](images/media/image162.png)

Next, in the Management locks, click on **Add**. If you want to create a
lock at the parent level, select the parent. The currently selected
resource inherits the lock from the parent. For example, you can lock
the resource group to apply a lock to all its resources.

![](images/media/image163.png)

Give the lock a name and lock level.

![](images/media/image164.png)

To delete the lock, select the ellipsis and **Delete** from the
available options

![](images/media/image165.png)

![](images/media/image166.png)

#### Task 2: Enable Transparent Data Encryption

If we have sensitive data, we can encrypt the data without impacting the
application. Transparent data encryption encrypts your database,
backups, and logs at rest without any changes to your application. For
newer databases, this service is automatically turned on. You may need
to be manually enabled for older databases.

![](images/media/image167.png)

If you want to supply your own key (BYOK), you can store it on Azure Key
Vault.

![](images/media/image168.png)

#### Task 3: Scale Up Database Performance

When our database was migrated, only a Standard S0, 10 DTUs, 250 GB
database was provisioned, the minimum DTUs for a Standard subscription.
We need to scale out our database to at least 100 DTUs or Standard S3:
100 DTUs, 250 GB database configuration. In the blade for your database,
click on the **Configure** section and slide the DTU slider to 100, then
click **Apply**.

![](images/media/image169.png)

#### Task 4: Configure Firewall and virtual networks

Under the **Security** blade, navigate to **Firewalls and virtual
networks.** We want to seal off any access from anyone except us. To
allow access to Azure services, click on **ON**.

![](images/media/image170.png)

#### Task 5: Threat Detection and Vulnerability Assessment

We want to help protect our database sever again threats. This service
includes Threat Detection, Data Discovery & Classification, and
Vulnerability Assessment. There is a small fee per server/month to run
this service. Enable these settings by navigating to the Security
section in the SQL Server blade and select **Advanced Threat
Protection**.

In the storage details section, select the same storage account used for
the web application.

**Note**: For performance purposes, consider using a different storage
account in the same region as the database, but different from other
services.

![](images/media/image171.png)

#### Task 6: Turn on SQL Server Auditing

Navigate to the SQL Server. Located under the Security section, click on
Auditing. In this section we will enable the SQL Server. Specify which
Storage Account you want the logs to be exported too and click on
**Save.**

![](images/media/image172.png)

#### Task 7: Automatic Tuning

In the SQL Server blade, select **Support+Troubleshooting** section.
Azure SQL Database has built-in intelligence to automatically tune your
databases to optimize performance. At the server level, you can enable
the Azure defaults. You can set the inherit state or force to be applied
or off for your database. Click on **Azure defaults** and click
**Apply.**

![](images/media/image173.png)

#### Task 8: Enable Database Diagnostics

If we need to troubleshoot or get a better understanding of whatâs going
on with our database and server, be sure to turn on the Database
diagnostics. In the blade, navigate to the database you want Diagnostics
turn on and click **Turn on Diagnostics**.

![](images/media/image174.png)

Next, to identify the diagnostics, type in the name. such as the name
and location of the database. If you want the logs to be saved to
Archived to a Storage Account, select the existing storage account.
Next, toggle the retention days you want to keep each log. **Note**: you
have the option to send the logs to Log Analytics or Stream to event
hub.

![](images/media/image175.png)

#### Task 9: Configure Long-term backup retention for database

SQL Database automatically creates database backup and uses Azure
read-access geo redundant storage (RA-GRS) to provide geo redundancy.
These backups are created automatically and at no additional cost. You
donât need to do anything to make it happen. SQL backup create full,
differential, and transaction log backups for Point-in-time restore
(PITR). The transaction log backups generally every 5-10 minutes,
depending on the performance level and database activity. Logs are kept
based off the DTI purchased vCore-based purchasing model. You can change
the default retention using either REST API or PowerShell. The default
values are 7, 14, 21, 28 or 35 days.

![](images/media/image176.png)

Our business requirements us to have 120 days back up, therefore, we
need to configure the Long-term backup retention. Navigation to the SQL
Server and under the Settings section, click on **Long-term backup
retention.** Select the **PartsUnlimitedDB** from the available
databases. In the Configure Policies, click **Weekly Backups**, type
**120** for the length and change the drown down interval to **Days**.
When done, click
**Apply.**

![](images/media/image177.png)

## Exercise 6: Optimize Entire Web Application Performance with Content Distributed Network (CDN)

Duration: 30 minutes

As the improvements have been rolling out to the Parts Unlimited site,
marketing has been ramping up its advertising causing an uptick in
traffic. While this is exactly what the company wants, it has caused
some latency issues. Improvements need to be made to the Parts Unlimited
site to reduce latency and improve end user experience. This must be
done quickly as there are additional marketing campaigns on the horizon.

To solve the performance issues as quickly as possible, we are going to
implement a Content Delivery Network for our site. It has been decided
that the entire site will be cached with CDN.

  - Create a CDN endpoint to Web App

  - Configure for correct behavior of when using Query String

  - Change for even faster performance by adding compression

With Azure CDN you have a choice of different CDN providers. Configuring
the service is quick, usually around a few minutes, and billing is based
on use as opposed to a
contract.

After services are created, browse the website in the edge URL to make
sure it is working.

Navigate through the product categories and notice that the same page is
being displayed for all categories, must be a problem with the query
string parameters, let's fix that.

#### Task 2: Configure Caching Rules

Click on the **CDN Endpoint** in the portal and then on the **Caching
Rules** property to see what is available. We can see there is a global
rule for **Query String caching behavior**, which is set to be ignored.
To fix the problem, change it to **Cache every unique URL**.

Now browse the website on the edge URL and do a fresh reload on the
category product pages and the problem should be fixed now, any
subsequent visits will be faster because data is cached in the CDN for
all pages.

#### Task 3: Improve performance by adding compression

We can improve the CDN performance even further with compression rules
for some types of files, specially text. Click on the **Compression**
property, enable it, and click **Save**, additional MIME types can be
added if desired:

Â 

Now browse the website after these changes and load time should be
faster\!

Custom CDN usage could be added only for portions of the site if this
approach is not desirable. In addition, custom domain and SSL
certificates can be added to an CDN
endpoint.

## Exercise 7: Optimize Partial Web Application Performance with Content Distributed Network (CDN)

Duration: 45 minutes

In the previous CDN exercise, we showed how you can turn on CDN for the
whole entire site. However, for some sites with special content such as
large files (e.g. large documents, video, etc.), we may want to optimize
the delivery for that specific type of content. This lab will show you
how to take a directory where your content in stored offload that
content to a CDN.

  - Create Resource Group & Storage Account

  - Create a CDN Profile

  - Create a CDN Endpoint

  - ouPublish Content: Copy images to storage account

  - Change code to use CDN

  - Explore additional features

#### Prerequisites

To complete this task, you should have provisioned the Parts Unlimited
IaaS and PaaS environments and have a working CI/CD process. You will
use the Developer Workstation deployed as part of the IaaS environment
for your development work.

#### Task 1: Create a Resource Group & Storage Account

**Note:** If you already created a Storage Group for the web app logs,
you can skip this step. If you already created a CDN Profile in the
previous lab, you can also skip this step and go to **Add CDN
Endpoint**.

Create a resource group called CDN to place all the resources to be used
for the Content Delivery Network. In the Azure Portal, click to add a
resource and look for Storage Account:

#### Task 4: Copy images to storage account

Use the Azure Storage Explorer in the Portal or [download
it](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/) to
connect to the storage account previously created:

Â 

After authenticating and locating the storage account in the Storage
Explorer, create an "images" Blob container:

If youâre using the Portalâs Storage explorer, Set the permission to
"Public read access for blobs only" to allow them to be accessible.

![](images/media/image190.png)

If youâre using the Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer for Windows:

Â 

You can test now by requesting in a browser the URL of the endpoint +

Â 

#### Task 5: Integrate into web application

We now need to add an Application Setting to use as source for the
images, say we call it CDNUrl, add it to the web.config file with no
value:

Â 

![Machine generated alternative text: Web.config 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

key="StoreServiceKey" value=" " key- -"CDNUr1" value= \</appSettings\>
](images/media/image196.png)

Â 

Adding it without value will ensure the changes we are introducing do
not change the behavior of the application. Now to make it easier to
use, we already have a **ConfigurationHelpers** class in the project, so
we can add the **PartsUnlimited.Utils** namespace in the
**Views/web.config** file to make it easier to use in our views. This
will shorten using this class in all places where we need it.

Â 

![Machine generated alternative text: Web.config -B X

](images/media/image197.png)

Â 

Now let's find the views that need to use the CDN for images, say we
only concentrate on the product images, so find the pattern **images/@**
in the **PartsUnlimitedWebsite** project:

![Machine generated alternative text: Find Results 1 \[+JFind all x

"/Images/@Mode1.Product.ProductArtUr1" alt="@Mode1.P
](images/media/image198.png)

Â 

We can see in the results that 3 of the files are related to showing
product images, we need to change those to use the **CDNUrl** setting,
the quickest way would be to simply using the
**ConfigurationHelpers.GetString** method, like the following screenshot
shows in the **Views/Store/Details.cshtml** file:

![Machine generated alternative text: Details.cshtml 7 8 9 10 11 12 13

\</div\> alt="@Mode1. Product . Title" ](images/media/image199.png)

Â 

Add the @**ConfigurationHelpers.GetString("CDNUrl")** to all 3 files and
test the application to make sure all images are still displayed
correctly.

Now add the value of the **CDNUrl** application setting using the name
of the endpoint from the Azure Portal:

![Machine generated alternative text: partsunlimited Endpoint p Search

Optimization type General web delivery Visual Studio Enterprise
Subscription ID ca4f2f4a-1d81-4f32-af97-849d45806dec
](images/media/image195.png)

Â 

Now test the application with the product images being served via CDN.

At this point the product images could be removed from the project or
marked with build action to **None** and avoid them being included in
the build artifacts.

The deployment of the images to the storage account could also be
automated using:

**CLI**  
az storage blob
upload-batch

**PowerShell**

Set-AzureStorageBlobContent

[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/azure.storage/Set-AzureStorageBlobContent?view=azurermps-5.3.0](mhtml:file://C:\\Users\\danshue\\Desktop\\Workshop\\AppMigrationAndModernizationWorkshopPresenter.mht!https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/azure.storage/Set-AzureStorageBlobContent?view=azurermps-5.3.0)

Add a comment to your change set and commit/sync your changes, which
will start a CI/CD.

Azure Redis Cache is based on the popular ppe\!-' soprge Redis Cache. It
gives users access to a secure, dedicated Redis Cache, managed by
Microsoft. Users get the best of both worlds, the rich Redis feature set
and ecosystem, and reliable hosting and monitoring from Microsoft.
Microsoft Azure Redis Cache is available in the follcnving tiers: â¢
Basicâ Single node, multiple sizes, ideal for development/test and
non-critical workloads. The basic tier has no SLA â¢ Standard â A
replicated cache in a two node Primary/Secondary configuration managed
by Microsoft, with a high availability SLA. Premium - The new Premium
tier includes all the Standard-tier features and more, such as better
performance compared to Basic or Standard-tier Caches, bigger workloads,
data persistence, and enhanced network security. Microsoft Azure Redis
Cache helps your application stay responsive even as user load
increases. It does so by leveraging the low latency, high-throughput
capabilities of the Redis engine. This separate distributed cache layer
allows your data tier to scale independently for more efficient use of
compute resources in your application layer. 102.28K 128.35K liÃ©o.63,

#### Task 2: Improve Session Performance

Remote into the vmdev01 using the User Name and Password used when
creating the environment.

> ![](images/media/image52.png)

**Note**:

Default Admin: sysadmin

Default Password: Password$123

> ![](images/media/image11.png)
> 
> ![](images/media/image53.png)

Note: Upgrade Framework to .NET 4.5.2

Install the NuGet package **Microsoft.Web.RedisSessionStateProvider** in
the **PartsUnlimitedWebsite** project.

Modify the **Web.config** to add a new connection string replacing the
\[SERVER\_NAME\] and \[KEY\] values.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>&lt;add name="RedisCacheConnectionString"</p>
<p>connectionString="[SERVER_NAME].redis.cache.windows.net:6380,password=[KEY],ssl=True,abortConnect=False" /&gt;</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Â 

Add the following section in the **Web.config** file, within the
**system.web** element. If the sessionState node already exist, replace
it with the following which uses that connection string:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Â Â &lt;sessionState mode="Custom" customProvider="MySessionStateStore"&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;providers&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;add type = "Microsoft.Web.Redis.RedisSessionStateProvider"</p>
<p>name = "MySessionStateStore"</p>
<p>connectionString = "RedisCacheConnectionString"/&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/providers&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/sessionState&gt;</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Â 

**Note**: Use the connection string method to be able to be able to
change the values at runtime without deploying your code.

After the changes, run locally to verify everything has been configured
correctly by simply navigate to the Shopping Cart on the website, add a
few items to the cart, then check the statistics on the Redis Cache:

![Machine generated alternative text: \> \_ Console Essentials Delete

Â 

To prove this works, scale out to 2 instances, repeat adding some
products to the cart. Scale down and keep doing the same actions on the
site and everything should work without any data being lost.

Â 

#### Task 4: Speed Up Output and Reduce Memory Footprint

The next thing we want to do is reduce the memory footprint and speed up
the output when customers browse the store front. While we have some
performance gains by adding a CDN across the site, we also can make
further improvements by making some minor changes to our code based
specific to the store.

Install the NuGet package **Microsoft.Web.RedisOutputCacheProvider** in
the **PartsUnlimitedWebsite** project.

Second, add the following section in the **Web.config** file, within the
**system.web** element:

Â 

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Â Â Â Â &lt;caching&gt;<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â &lt;outputCacheÂ defaultProvider="MyStoreRedisOutputCache"&gt;<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â &lt;providers&gt;<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â &lt;addÂ name="MyRedisOutputCache"Â type="Microsoft.Web.Redis.RedisOutputCacheProvider"Â host="REDIS_HOSTNAME"Â accessKey="PRIMARY_KEY"Â ssl="true"Â /&gt;<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â &lt;/providers&gt;<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â &lt;/outputCache&gt;<br />
Â Â Â Â &lt;/caching&gt;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Â 

Third, modify the **Controllers\\StoreController.cs** file to add the
following attributes in the Browse and Details functions:

Â 

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>[OutputCache(DurationÂ =Â 30,Â VaryByParamÂ =Â "*")]<br />
publicÂ ActionResultÂ Browse(intÂ categoryId)<br />
â¦<br />
Â </p>
<p>[OutputCache(DurationÂ =Â 30,Â VaryByParamÂ =Â "id")]<br />
publicÂ ActionResultÂ Details(intÂ id)</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Â 

Notice the first one will cache the output taking into accounts all the
parameters, the second one will do it only for the id parameter.

You can verify by adding a breakpoint inside the methods and visiting a
product in the website, the first time you visit the page the code will
hit the breakpoint, subsequent visits to the page will not.

#### Task 5: Reducing database utilization

This next section, we will demonstrate how to reduce the amount of
database utilization by using Redis as a custom caching provider. This
will require some custom code.

If not already installed, install the NuGet package
**StackExchange.Redis.StrongName** in the **PartsUnlimitedWebsite**
project.

Right-Click on the PartsUnlintedWebSite project name in Solution
Explorer. Select **Manage NuGet Packagesâ¦** from the available options.
From the NuGet Manager screen on the Browse tab, search for
**StackExchange.Redis.StrongName** and **Install** the latest version.

Create a new C\# file in the **Utils** folder called **RedisHelper.cs**
and copy the contents below into that new file.

Â Â 

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>using Newtonsoft.Json;</p>
<p>using StackExchange.Redis;</p>
<p>using System;</p>
<p>using System.Collections.Generic;</p>

<p>private static JsonSerializerSettings serializerSettings;</p>
<p>static RedisHelper()</p>
<p>{</p>

<p>};</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>private static Lazy&lt;ConnectionMultiplexer&gt; lazyConnection = new Lazy&lt;ConnectionMultiplexer&gt;(() =&gt;</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>string redisHost = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["RedisCacheConnectionString"];</p>
<p>return ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect(redisHost);</p>
<p>});</p>
<p>public static ConnectionMultiplexer Connection</p>
<p>{</p>

<p>{</p>
<p>return lazyConnection.Value;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>public static T Get&lt;T&gt;(string key)</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>var r = Connection.GetDatabase().StringGet(key);</p>
<p>return Deserialize&lt;T&gt;(r);</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>public static List&lt;T&gt; GetList&lt;T&gt;(string key)</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>return Get&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt;(key);</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>public static void SetList&lt;T&gt;(string key, List&lt;T&gt; list)</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>Set(key, list);</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>public static void Set(string key, object value)</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>Connection.GetDatabase().StringSet(key, Serialize(value));</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>static string Serialize(object o)</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>if (o == null)</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>return null;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>return JsonConvert.SerializeObject(o, serializerSettings);</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>static T Deserialize&lt;T&gt;(string value)</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>if (value == null)</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>return default(T);</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;T&gt;(value, serializerSettings);</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

We now need to ensure our models can be serialized, which is required by
Redis. Navigate to the Models folder and add **\[Serializable\]**
attribute to the top of the **Product.cs** and **Category.cs**:Â 

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>namespaceÂ PartsUnlimited.Models<br />
{<br />
Â Â Â Â [Serializable]<br />
Â Â Â Â publicÂ classÂ Product<br />
Â Â Â Â {</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Â 

Note: The system assembly also needs to be referenced, add âusing
System;â before the namespace.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>using System;</p>
<p>namespaceÂ PartsUnlimited.Models<br />
{<br />
Â Â Â Â [Serializable]<br />
Â Â Â Â publicÂ classÂ Category<br />
Â Â Â Â {</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Â 

Modify the **HomeController.cs** to use Redis instead of the
MemoryCache:

Â 

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>publicÂ ActionResultÂ Index()<br />
{<br />
Â Â Â Â //Â GetÂ mostÂ popularÂ products<br />
Â Â Â Â varÂ topSellingProductsÂ =Â Utils.RedisHelper.GetList&lt;Product&gt;("topselling");<br />
Â Â Â Â ifÂ (topSellingProductsÂ ==Â null)<br />
Â Â Â Â {<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â topSellingProductsÂ =Â GetTopSellingProducts(4);<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Utils.RedisHelper.SetList("topselling",Â topSellingProducts);<br />
Â Â Â Â }<br />
<br />
Â Â Â Â varÂ newProductsÂ =Â Utils.RedisHelper.GetList&lt;Product&gt;("newarrivals");<br />
Â Â Â Â ifÂ (newProductsÂ ==Â null)<br />
Â Â Â Â {<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â newProductsÂ =Â GetNewProducts(4);<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Utils.RedisHelper.SetList("newarrivals",Â newProducts);<br />
Â Â Â Â }<br />
<br />
Â Â Â Â varÂ viewModelÂ =Â newÂ HomeViewModel<br />
Â Â Â Â {<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â NewProductsÂ =Â newProducts,<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â TopSellingProductsÂ =Â topSellingProducts,<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â CommunityPostsÂ =Â GetCommunityPosts()<br />
Â Â Â Â };<br />
<br />
Â Â Â Â returnÂ View(viewModel);<br />
}</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Validate our changes by adding a breakpoint on the first line of the
Index() function in the HomeController.cs and run the website locally. A
call to the **GetTopSellingProducts** and **GetNewProducts** should be
made only the first time the page loads.

If everything works as expected, then comment and commit/sync your code
into Azure DevOps.

## Exercise 9: Improve Quality & Performance of Search with Azure Search

Duration: 30 minutes

It has come to the businesses attention that customers are not able to
find what they are looking for easily. After some investigation it was
determined that the existing search capabilities were not adequate and
needed to be updated. To improve the applicationâs search capability as
quickly as possible, with as little code as possible, while ensuring the
ability to support the sites growing traffic, Azure Search will be
implemented.

  - Go to the Azure Portal

  - Look at the Parts Unlimited DB config

  - Add Azure Search

  - Create a branch

  - Modify the application to use Azure Search

  - Test Local

  - Commit and push to release

  - Test in production

| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Azure Search | <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/> |

#### Prerequisites

To complete this task, you should have provisioned the Parts Unlimited
IaaS and PaaS environments and have a working CI/CD process. You will
use the Developer Workstation deployed as part of the IaaS environment
for your development work.

#### Task 1: Create Azure Search Service

Current search is based on SQL queries and prone to bad results. Doing a
search like "jumper" or "leads" will return a product match like the
following:

![Machine generated alternative text: â Parts unlimited l' MSW Sales CRM

Â 

Clicking on the Product, we can see a lot more text that could be
searched for:

![Machine generated alternative text: Product - Jumper Leads X + v MSW

Â 

But doing a search on text within the Product's description or details,
like "corrosion" would not return any matches:

Â 

In the Azure Portal, create a new instance of **Azure Search**:

![Machine generated alternative text: New - Microsoft Azure MSW Sales

Â 

Enter the **name** and **resource group** for the service and click
create:

#### Task 2: Configure Azure Search

After the service is created, we must proceed to create an index and
populate it with data. To start this process, we will take advantage of
the existing database and use the **Import Data** wizard:

![Machine generated alternative text: partsunlimited - Micros https://

Â 

Provide the details for a data source, selecting the type of source, in
our case **Azure SQL Database** and providing the connection string
values and selecting the **Table/View** of **Products**: For the name,
since this is a unique value, type in the host name associated with the
application. After typing the name, select the partsUnlimitedDB for the
database, UserId, and Password, click on **Test connection** in order to
verify the credentials are correct.

**Note**: Use the same name for the database that you used when you
created the environment. Note, you may also need to change the login to
\[username\]@hostname.

Configure the index, name it **products-index**, select all fields to be
retrievable and select as *searchable* **Title**, **Description** and
**ProductDetails**:

Define the indexer property to update the data in the index, in this
case we will select **Once** and click **Ok**. To setup recurring
indexer we would need a field to use to track changes, which we don't
have now, but adding a field like **UpdatedDate** that is updated every
time the product fields are updated would work.

#### Task 3: Integrate search into application

Â Remote into the vmdev01 using the User Name and Password used when
creating the environment.

**Note**:

Default Admin: sysadmin

Default Password: Password$123

> ![](images/media/image11.png)

Upgrade the **PartsUnlimitedWebsite** project to target at least the
**.Net Framework 4.5.2** to be able to use the Azure Search SDK. This is
done via the properties page of the project.

You must add the NuGet package **Microsoft.Azure.Search** that will
enable us to code against the Azure Search service. This can be done
from the Package Manager Console with the following command:

*Install-Package Microsoft.Azure.Search*

Add some entries in the **Web.config** that will be used to setup the
values for integrating with the Azure Search service. The value for the
**SearchServiceQueryApiKey** is obtained from the **Azure Search
Service/Keys/Manage Search Query** blade.

![](images/media/image215.png)

Â 

![](images/media/image216.png)

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>&lt;add key="SearchServiceName" value="partsunlimited"/&gt;Â </p>
<p>&lt;add key="SearchServiceQueryApiKey" value="*************"/&gt;Â </p>
<p>&lt;add key="SearchServiceIndexName" value="products-index"/&gt;</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Â 

Add a new class called **AzureIndexProductSearch** in the
**ProductSearch** directory:

<table>

<p>Â </p>
<p>foreach (var r in searchResults.Results)Â </p>

<p>Â </p>
<p>private static SearchIndexClient CreateSearchIndexClient()Â </p>
<p>{Â </p>
<p>string searchServiceName = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["SearchServiceName"];Â </p>
<p>string queryApiKey = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["SearchServiceQueryApiKey"];Â </p>
<p>string indexName = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["SearchServiceIndexName"];Â </p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>return new SearchIndexClient(searchServiceName, indexName, new SearchCredentials(queryApiKey));</p>
<p>}Â <br />
}<br />
}</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Â 

Replace the class used for the search in the **UnityConfig.cs** file in
the **App\_Start**
directory:

Replace:

Â 

|                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| container.RegisterType\<IProductSearch,Â StringContainsProductSearch\>(); |

Â 

with:

|                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| container.RegisterType\<IProductSearch,Â AzureIndexProductSearch\>(); |

Â 

#### Task 4: Verify Search Results

Running the application should allow us to perform the same search as
before for "jumper" or "leads" and obtain the same results. However, it
is possible now to obtain results by searching by the word "corrosion"
and getting as expected the Product with that text in the Description:

#### Task 5: Commit & Sync Code

When youâre all done verifying the search is working on your local
machine, comment, commit, and sync your code. This will kick off the
CI/CD. Once Azure DevOps Release Management deploys the code, perform a spot
check to verify the changes youâve made to the search is showing
up.

## Exercise 10: Accelerate development and take advantage of serverless using Azure Functions

Duration: 45 minutes

Parts Unlimited has been growing. The business wants to start building
relationships with other retailers, so they can sell their product
through multiple channels, not just Parts Unlimited.

To get started, the Parts Unlimited site needs to be improved
architecturally so portions of its functionality can be reused when
integrating with third parties. To accomplish this, the products model
will be split into a reusable class. Functions will then be built using
this class. Next, the Parts Unlimited website will be modified to use
the Azure functions as opposed to accessing the database
directly.

#### Help references

| Azure Functions                              | <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/>                                      |

#### Prerequisites

To complete this task, you should have provisioned the Parts Unlimited
IaaS and PaaS environments and have a working CI/CD process. You will
use the Developer Workstation deployed as part of the IaaS environment
for your development work.

#### Task 1: RefactorÂ 

Add a new **PartsUnlimitedModels** Class Library (.Net Framework)
project to the Visual Studio solution to move all models classes, make
sure to select **.Net Framework 4.5.2**:

#### Task 2: Modernize

Add a new **Azure Functions** project to the solution called
**PartsUnlimitedStoreService** using the **Cloud** templates:

create an Azure Function project. Browse... ](images/media/image224.png)

Â 

When creating a new Azure Functions project, make sure to change the
framework to âAzure Functions v1 (.NET Framework), then click **OK** to
continue.

![](images/media/image225.png)

Â 

**Note**: Make search the **PartsUnlimitedModels** and
**PartsUnlimitedStoreService** projects are both running the same .NET
framework version

After the project is created, weâll create three new Functions. The 3
functions in the Function App: **BrowseCategory**, **GetCategories** &
**GetProductDetails** to provide the functionality currently available
in the **StoreController** in the **PartsUnlimitedWebsite** project.
They should be accessed via URLs in the form **"/api/categories"**,
**"/api/categories/{id}"** & **"/api/products/{id}"** respectively.

![](images/media/image226.png)

Right click on the new **PartsUnlimitedStoreService** project, choose
**Add**, **New Azure Function**.

![](images/media/image227.png)

Select the **Http trigger** and the Access Rights as **Function**.

![](images/media/image228.png)

Next, make a reference to our **PartsUnlimitedModels** project:

![](images/media/image229.png)

Add a reference to the same version of the **EntityFramework** that
youâre using in the web project. In the Solution Explorer, right-click
on dependencies and select **Manage NuGet Package.** Click the
**Browse** tab and search for EntityFramework.

Notice that for this to work, we will need the connection string to the
database available for the Function App to work, which locally can be
set in the **local.settings.json** file:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>{<br />
Â Â "IsEncrypted":Â false,<br />
Â Â "Values":Â {<br />
Â Â Â Â "AzureWebJobsStorage":Â "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",<br />
Â Â Â Â "AzureWebJobsDashboard":Â "UseDevelopmentStorage=true"<br />

Â Â "ConnectionStrings":Â {<br />
Â Â Â Â "DefaultConnectionString":Â "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=PartsUnlimitedWebsite;IntegratedÂ Security=True;"<br />
Â Â }<br />
}</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Â 

Create a new class called **GlobalConfiguration.cs** and replace its
contents with the snippet below:

Â 

The function can now be tested locally using an Http Client like Postman
or any other of your choice. To test, right-click on
**PartsUnlimitedStoreService** as click on **Set as Startup Project**.

![](images/media/image230.png)

If prompted to install the Azure Function CLI tools, click **Yes**.

![](images/media/image231.png)

After a moment, youâll see a command window appear running func.exe.
Note the URLs

![](images/media/image232.png)

Run Postman from the Desktop and issue a GET against the
**GetCategories** /api/GetCategories

![](images/media/image233.png)

#### Task 3: Integrate

Replace the code in **StoreController.cs** in the
**PartsUnlimitedWebsite** project to retrieve data from the Function App
by making a REST call to the appropriate endpoint.

**Tip**: Using a utility class like **System.Net.Http.HttpClient** makes
it easy to implement the calls and writing a generic method convenient
for reusability.

The URL of the Function App should be defined in the **Web.config** to
easily change it during deployment and if a key is to be used for access
control should be also in configuration. Add the following two lines to
the \<appSettings\> section, replacing the value of the
StoreServiceBaseAddress with your local instance.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>&lt;add key="StoreServiceBaseAddress" value="http://localhost:7071/api/" /&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;add key="StoreServiceKey" value="" /&gt;</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Next add to the bottom of the **StoreController.cs** method:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>privateÂ staticÂ asyncÂ Task&lt;T&gt;Â GetFromStoreService&lt;T&gt;(stringÂ path)<br />

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Â 

Add the **System.Threading.Tasks**, **System.Collections.Generic,
System.Net.Http, and System.Net.Http.Headers**, **System.Net**;
reference to the top of the class. Then replace the Intex(),
Browse(int), Details(int) methods with the ones below. Notice the public
methods in the class can be implemented in an asynchronous way and
simpler:

Â 

Test locally and ensure everything works as expected and no
functionality has been affected from the website standpoint.

In Solution Explorer, right-click on the Solution and click **Set
Startup Projects**. Select Multiple startup projects and for the action
for **PartsUnlimitedStoreService** and **PartsUnlimitedWebsite**, choose
**Start**.

Browse the product categories and details of the site and notice the
Functions getting executed.

![](images/media/image234.png)

#### Task 4: Publish the Service

Now that we have a working Function App with the website, it is time to
deploy to Azure, which can be accomplished using the Publish feature in
Visual Studio. Before we continue, we need to update the Azure Functions
and Web Jobs Tools in Visual Studio.

![](images/media/image235.png)

![](images/media/image236.png)

Once Visual Studio has restarted, reload the project and begin
publishing.

Â 

Select the **Function App** target and **Create new** option:

![Machine generated alternative text: x Pick a publish target What
publishing targets can you deploy your app to? Targets Azure Function
App @ Create New O Select Existing Folder Import profile Publish Cancel
](images/media/image238.png)

Enter or select the appropriate values for the publish profile,
selecting the Consumption for the hosting plan and your existing Storage
Account used for the website. You can also choose your existing website
to host the Functions.

![](images/media/image239.png)

Decide how this function will be hosted. It will either use a
Consumption Plan, where Microsoft manages the scaling up/down the
infrastructure to support your Function or an existing App Plan to take
advantage of infrastructure youâve already defined. Select your existing
Storage Account where youâre storing the Application Log files. After
everything is configured, click **Create** to continue.

![](images/media/image240.png)

In a few moments, the new enviornment will be configured and the
deployment to that will begin.

![](images/media/image241.png)

#### Task 5: Configure Function Database Connection

Once the Function is complete, using the Azure Portal, navigate to the
newly created Function **App Service**. Notice the Function Icon.

![](images/media/image242.png)

You can navigation to the URL for the Function App to verify the
Function has been provisioned correctly.

![](images/media/image243.png)

![](images/media/image244.png)

Â 

After publishing the Function App, we need to add the required
Connection String for the database, which can be done via the Azure
portal:

After publishing is completed, publish a new version of the website
including the Application Settings for the location and key of the Store
Service and test.

**Default Settings**

db Login Name: workshopServiceAcc  
db User Name: workshopServiceAcc  
db User Password: P2ssw0rd

**Note**: Be sure to the Connection String has a space between User and
ID (e.g. âUser IDâ), otherwise the Entity Framework will throw an
exception âKeyword not supported: 'userid'â. This is a known issue with
the version of Entity Framework being used and has been corrected in a
later version.

#### Task 5: Configure Function Application Insights 

![](images/media/image246.png)

Click **Configure**.

![](images/media/image247.png)

Next, you have a choice to create a new Application Insights instance or
select your existing resource. Since we want to see everything in area,
weâll select our existing application and click **OK.** After
configuring Application Insights, notice the Live Stream is now
available.

![](images/media/image248.png)

Use Postman to verify that everything the function can communicate with
the database and Application Insights in configured correctly.

In Postman, send a Get to the Function Service using the URL
(<https://[service_name].azurewebsites.net/api/categories>) and ensure
the payload coming back is the json results.

![](images/media/image249.png)

Instead of configuring our web application to use the Function directly,
in our next Exercise, weâll configure our website to go through API
Management instead.

#### Task 6: Modify App Service CI/CD Task

The solution file will now produce artifacts for the web application,
**PartsUnlimitedWebsite.zip**, and one for the store,
**PartsUnlimitedStoreService.zip**. Our current build task will fail
since it canât deploy multiple ZIP files to the service, therefore, we
need to specify the correct file. Navigate to your Azure DevOps instance, to
Releases, and modify the App Service deployment task to have the correct
file.

## Exercise 11: Monetize your data and services, and open new channels to customers using Azure API Management

Duration: 45 minutes

Now that Parts Unlimited has an API available, the business wants to
start building relationships with other retailers, so they can sell
their product through multiple channels. Weâve decided to use Azure API
Management to expose and manage our
API.

**References**

- [API Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/)

### Task 1: Create Azure API Management

Since the creation of the Azure API Management takes a little bit to
provision, we will configure it now. In the Azure Portal, create a new
instance of API Management:

![Machine generated alternative text: Microsoft Azure Home \> Resource
groups Everything Filte API management Results NAME API management
Report a bug Server-Migration-EastUS \> Everything Search resources,
services and docs x x ManageEngine DesktopCentral MSP ManageEngine
Desktop Central PUBLISHER Microsoft ManageEngine ManageEngine CATEGORY
Web + Mobile Compute Compute ](images/media/image46.png)

Â 

Type in the name (e.g. use the same name as your web application),
choose the region thatâs the same as the web application that is already
deployed, then type in the organization name, and then type your email
address. When youâre all done, click **Create.** Provisioning this
resource can take up to 1 hour.

### Task 2: Set up new a new API in the Azure Portal

To create a new API in Azure API Management, we will use the OpenAPI
definition (Swagger) from our web application.

Add a new API using the Azure Portal:

![Machine generated alternative text: Microsoft Azure Report a bug

Â 

To add an OpenAPI definition, go to the Function App and use the

Â 

The auto generated API definition is not complete and contains a few
placeholders that should be edited manually, for simplicity use **-
application/json** as value for the **produces** and **consumes**
attributes, add descriptions and remove the security related attributes.

With exception of the HOST attribute (make sure to use hostname), the
swagger should look like the following:

<table>

Â 

Now add the API to API Management as attempted before and the error
should not be present anymore, make sure to only add the **Unlimited**
product:

![](images/media/image257.png)

After your selections, click **Create**.

You can now test each of the methods of API in API Management, like the
following test with get categories:

Update the web project GetFromStoreService method to pass the
StoreServiceKey value in the HTTP header request. Change the
StoreServiceBaseAddress in the AppSetting section of the **Web.Config**.

Run the project locally and if everything works, then commit and push
your code to the repository. After the build has complete.

#### Task 3: Enable Application Insights

Now that the API is set, we want to further monitor application
performance and be able to easily trace down exceptions when this
occurs. Configure Application Insights by navigating to the Application
Insights (preview). In the stop, **Select Application Insights** and
pick the web application subscription. This will mark settings as
**Enabled** and automatically insert the instrumentation key, click on
**Save**.

![](images/media/image260.png)

After the site has been deployed, explore the live site. Navigate back
to the Azure Portal and explore Application Insight. Look at the
different dependencies being called Database, Function, and API
Management.

#### Task 4: Explore the API Management (APIM) Developer Portal

From the APIM resource in the Azure Portal, click on the link to the
Developer Portal:

![Machine generated alternative text: Parts Unlimited API HOME APIS

automatically generated API Documentation that describes how to use the
APIs and includes code samples in multiple languages. The API Console
allows you to directly interact with the API right here in the developer
portal. Developer Support API publishers can engage directly with their
API community, keeping them up to date via the integrated blog.
Developers can log and discuss issues and even submit their applications
to the application gallery. powered by Microsoft Azure

Â 

Here you can sign up for access to the API, browse through API
definitions and test them, check the products and applications
available.

Here you will also have the possibility to customize styles for the look
and feel of the developer portal:

## After the hands-on workshop 

Duration: 10 minutes

In this exercise, attendees will deprovision any Azure resources that
were created in support of the
lab.

#### Task 1: Delete the Resource Group in which you placed your Azure resources.

1.  From the Portal, navigate to the blade of your Resource Group and
    click Delete in the command bar at the top

2.  Confirm the deletion by re-typing the resource group name and
    clicking Delete

You should follow all steps provided *after* attending the hands-on lab.
